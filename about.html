                  Fabiano Roggio is an Italian actor from Barletta.

Fabiano underwent three years professional actor training at Accademia d’Arte Dramatica Cassiopea (Academy of Dramatic Arts Cassiopea) in Rome.

After this training he was selected to attend a Masterclass led by Bernard Hiller where he was one of three selected by Beatrice Kruger to receive a scholarship to attend another Masterclass in LA.

After working in Italy for a year, Fabiano moved to Dublin where he enrolled in The Gaiety School of Acting’s Performance Theatre Company (class of 2016).

Most recent theatre works include Theatre Lovett: ‘Out and About with Pietr Kloon’ at Kaleidoscope Festival.

His recent film credits includes The Man Who Invented Christmas (Parallel Films) and the recently aired Resistance (RTÉ)

                  Well if our newest Castaway recruit Fabiano Roggio wasn’t busy enough with Theatre Lovett a couple of weeks back, he’s only went and gotten himself cast alongside two of our brightest young actors working in Dublin! Fabiano opened with ‘Dinner in Mulberry Street’ in Bewley’s Café Theatre today, further details are attached below so all I’ll say is get your tickets while you can as with the festive season upon us, they’re flying out the door!*
